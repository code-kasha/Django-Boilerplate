Hello, creating perfect Django boilerplate can be quite time consuming, so here's my version of it.

Things Included:

- Basic Templates (Bootstrap 5) - base.html (i've used injection, check base folder for contents)
- Bootsrap Bundle (JS/CSS)
- A default profile avatar

Just clone, install requirements.txt and get going!
